Even Realities G1 BLE Protocol
This doc aims to outline the BLE protocol for the Even Realities G1. The G1 operates with two BLE radios, one for the left arm and one for the right. Some commands need to be sent individually to both arms and some are only sent to one arm. Each radio operates as a stream of packets using the Nordic BLE UART.

Serial Number Decoder Ring
The serial number can be fetched from the BLE Scan Result object. For example:S110LAAL103842

	Generic Command Response
Many commands will simply respond with a generic success/failure message. The header will repeat the command id back, and one additional byte which will be either success or failure. This is recorded here and referenced by all commands that operate this way to avoid duplicating the same response for all such messages.

	Commands
Commands are messages the App can send to the glasses. The glasses may optionally respond.
Control
Commands that change send one off information to the glasses for them to act on.
Microphone Control (0x0E)
        enable:
            0: Disable the MIC (turn off sound pickup).
            1: Enable the MIC (turn on sound pickup).

            0xCA: Failure
        enable:
            0: MIC disabled.
