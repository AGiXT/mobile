# solana_wallet_adapter_platform_interface

A platform interface for the [solana_wallet_adapter](https://pub.dev/packages/solana_wallet_adapter) plugin.

## Breaking Changes

Prefer living with a less-clean platform API than making a breaking change (e.g by adding a method instead of renaming). See [Platform Interface Breaking Changes](https://flutter.dev/go/platform-interface-breaking-changes) for more details.
