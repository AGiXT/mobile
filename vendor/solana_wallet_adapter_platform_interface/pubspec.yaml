flutter:

  # To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - badges/
    - logos/
  
  # For details regarding assets in packages, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  #
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: SolanaWalletIcons
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/SolanaWalletIcons.ttf

  # For details regarding fonts in packages, see
