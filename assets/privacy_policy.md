# AGiXT Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** October 29, 2025  \
**Privacy Contact:** support@devxt.com

## 1. Introduction
AGiXT Mobile, Developed by DevXT. Explains in this policy how the AGiXT mobile app and connected services handle personal information. By using the app you agree to these practices.

## 2. Data We Collect
We gather only what we need to operate and secure the app:

- **Personal data:** Your name, email, wallet details, authentication tokens, and profile settings.
- **Usage data:** Session activity, feature interactions, diagnostics, crash reports, and support history.
- **Content you provide:** Files, calendar items, checklists, voice notes, or other information you upload or connect. These inputs can contain sensitive data; share only what you need for the app to work.
- **Automatically collected data:** Device identifiers, IP address, OS version, app version, and similar telemetry gathered through cookies or SDKs.

We do not knowingly collect information from anyone under 16 without verified parental consent.

## 3. How We Use Data
We use your information to deliver and improve AGiXT: provide core features, personalize responses, run analytics, train and refine models on the content you share, communicate about updates or support, enforce our terms, and meet legal obligations. We will not use your data for unrelated purposes without your consent.

## 4. Data Sharing
We share data only when necessary:

- **Vendors:** Trusted service providers (hosting, analytics, customer support, payments) operating under confidentiality commitments.
- **Legal requests:** When required to comply with law or protect rights, property, or safety.
- **Business events:** If we merge, acquire, or sell assets, consistent safeguards will apply.

We never sell personal information. Sensitive or regulated data is shared only with your explicit, informed consent. Cross-border transfers rely on approved safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses.

## 5. Your Rights
Depending on your location, you may request access, correction, deletion, or portability of your data, and you may opt out of optional processing at any time. Email privacy@agixt.dev with your request; we respond within 30 days unless the law requires a different timeline. Withdrawing consent may limit app functionality but does not affect prior lawful processing.

## 6. Data Security
We protect information with industry-standard encryption in transit and at rest, role-based access controls. If a breach occurs, we notify affected users and regulators without undue delay.

## 7. Data Retention
We keep personal data only as long as it is needed for the purposes outlined here or to satisfy legal duties. Unless you ask for earlier deletion, user-generated content is retained for up to one year, after which it is removed or anonymized. We may delete data sooner to manage storage resources. When you request deletion, we remove or anonymize the data unless retention is legally required.

## 8. Third Parties
The app may link to or integrate with third-party services (for example, calendars, wallets, or analytics). Their privacy policies govern their use of your data; review them before sharing information.

## 9. Minors
AGiXT is not intended for users under the age of 18.

## 10. Updates
We may amend or change this policy at any time. Your continued use of the app means you accept the revisions.
