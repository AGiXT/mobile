# Temperature Unit Toggle Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Celsius/Fahrenheit toggle in the dashboard settings has been successfully implemented and verified to work correctly with the Even Realities G1 BLE protocol.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Dashboard Settings UI (`dashboard_screen.dart`)
- ✅ Toggle switch properly updates `UiPerfs.singleton.temperatureUnit`
- ✅ Immediately calls `TimeSync.updateTimeAndWeather()` when toggled
- ✅ Shows loading state during update
- ✅ Provides user feedback (success/error messages)
- ✅ Displays correct title ("Celsius" or "Fahrenheit") based on current setting

### 2. Temperature Unit Storage (`ui_perfs.dart`)
- ✅ `TemperatureUnit` enum with CELSIUS (index 0) and FAHRENHEIT (index 1)
- ✅ Persistent storage using SharedPreferences
- ✅ Default setting: Fahrenheit (matching UiPerfs default)

### 3. BLE Protocol Implementation (`time_sync.dart`)
- ✅ Temperature always sent in Celsius (byte 18) as required by G1 protocol
- ✅ Display flag (byte 19) correctly set: 0=Celsius display, 1=Fahrenheit display
- ✅ Uses real weather data from Open-Meteo API
- ✅ Proper BLE packet structure (21 bytes total)

### 4. Weather Service (`open_meteo_weather_service.dart`)
- ✅ Always fetches temperature in Celsius from Open-Meteo API
- ✅ No temperature conversion applied (API returns metric by default)
- ✅ Temperature rounded to integer for BLE transmission

## BLE Protocol Compliance

### Packet Structure (Command 0x06, Subcommand 0x01)
```
Byte 17: Weather Icon ID (0x00-0x10)
Byte 18: Temperature in Celsius (signed 8-bit integer)
Byte 19: Display Unit Flag (0=Celsius, 1=Fahrenheit)
Byte 20: Time Format Flag (0x00=12H, 0x01=24H)
```

### Critical Requirements Met
1. **Temperature Value**: Always in Celsius regardless of user preference
2. **Display Flag**: Correctly reflects user's preferred display unit
3. **No Conversion**: Temperature value is never converted to Fahrenheit
4. **Real Data**: Uses actual weather from Open-Meteo API, not simulated data

## User Workflow

1. **User opens Dashboard Settings**
   - Toggle shows current preference (default: Fahrenheit)

2. **User toggles Celsius/Fahrenheit switch**
   - UI immediately updates to show loading state
   - `UiPerfs.singleton.temperatureUnit` is updated
   - `TimeSync.updateTimeAndWeather()` is called

3. **BLE packet is created and sent**
   - Weather data fetched from Open-Meteo API (in Celsius)
   - Temperature rounded to integer (e.g., 22.5°C → 23°C)
   - Display flag set based on user preference (0 or 1)
   - Packet sent to both glasses

4. **User feedback provided**
   - Success: "Switched to Celsius/Fahrenheit on glasses"
   - Error: "Failed to update glasses temperature unit"
   - Not connected: "Glasses not connected - unit will be updated when connected"

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests
- ✅ BLE protocol compliance (`g1_weather_protocol_test.dart`)
- ✅ Temperature unit logic (`dashboard_temperature_integration_test.dart`)
- ✅ Dashboard toggle behavior (`dashboard_toggle_test.dart`)
- ✅ End-to-end workflow (`temperature_workflow_test.dart`)

### Test Scenarios Covered
- ✅ Temperature always stays in Celsius for BLE packets
- ✅ Display flag correctly reflects user preference
- ✅ Weather icon mapping to G1 protocol
- ✅ Temperature rounding behavior
- ✅ Enum persistence and retrieval
- ✅ Dashboard toggle state management

## Example BLE Packets

### With Celsius Display Preference
```
Weather: 22°C, Clear Day
Byte 17: 0x10 (Sunny icon)
Byte 18: 0x16 (22 in decimal = 22°C)
Byte 19: 0x00 (Celsius display flag)
```

### With Fahrenheit Display Preference
```
Weather: 22°C, Clear Day (same weather data)
Byte 17: 0x10 (Sunny icon)
Byte 18: 0x16 (22 in decimal = still 22°C)
Byte 19: 0x01 (Fahrenheit display flag)
```

## Verification

All requirements have been implemented and tested:

- [x] Real weather data integration with Open-Meteo API
- [x] Celsius/Fahrenheit toggle in dashboard settings
- [x] Correct BLE protocol implementation
- [x] Temperature always sent in Celsius
- [x] Display unit preference correctly handled
- [x] User feedback and loading states
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage
- [x] Protocol compliance verification

The temperature unit toggle is fully functional and ready for use with the Even Realities G1 glasses.
